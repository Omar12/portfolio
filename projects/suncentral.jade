        p SunCentral is a sun fact dashboard for SolarGard. SolarGard is a company that provides sun protection for windows. The intention is to make the sun more sociable. The sites goal is to keep the sun fun.
        p The goal was to make a relatively uninteresting product and brand, by making it connect to people by providing curious scientific data in a fun way. The “fun” was executed with the art direction, graphics, copywriting and playful animations.
        p Me and the designers brainstormed on the individual animations. The animations were CSS Transitions triggered with JavaScript. This allowed to control the timing of the animations.
