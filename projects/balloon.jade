        p The latest project that I have worked on. Balloon Agency is a project done with the company called From Somebody Else. Balloon (as we refer to it) is a website for a talent agency in NYC. Their talent consists of the people behind the scenes: the makeup artists, wardrobe experts, photographers, nutritionists and more. The target demographic is production companies looking for BTS talent.
        p The goal for the site is help promote these artists work by describing a bit about themselves, display their social streams and to showcase a sample of their work. The work can be a photographic collection or a video demo reel.
